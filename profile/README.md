**[Pulumi](https://pulumi.com)** is infrastructure as code in any programming language. Define cloud infrastructure on any cloud -- including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, and more -- using the full richness of programming languages, and Pulumi will provision, version, and otherwise manage your cloud resources.

## Benefits of Pulumi's approach

* **Any cloud**: Pulumi supports 100s of providers, including public clouds (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), private clouds (e.g., VMWare, OpenStack), cloud native (e.g., Kubernetes, Helm), and SaaS infrastructure providers (e.g., Cloudflare, MongoDB, Snowflake). Pulumi exposes the full surface area of these clouds with a consistent programming model and deployment model.

* **Rich programming languages**: Pulumi uses general purpose, popular programming languages including Go, Java, JavaScript, .NET, Python, TypeScript, and YAML. This gives you access to rich constructs like for loops, if statements, functions, classes, and packages. It also delivers great editor experiences with statement completion, error detection, and inline documentation.

* **Declarative infrastructure as code**: Despite offering the full richness of programming languages, Pulumi is declarative infrastructure as code at its core. This gives previews of changes before they are made, policy enforcement, a full history of who changed what infrastructure and when, and all the things that are standard with infrastructure provisioning tools.

* **Programmable infrastructure**: Embed infrastructure as code into larger pieces of software using the [Automation API](https://pulumi.com/automation), which is the ability to invoke Pulumi as a library in your chosen language.

* **Share and reuse patterns**: Codify, share, and reuse standard infrastructure patterns with reusable components. This avoids copy and pasting and needing to reinvent the wheel over and over again.

* **Integrated configuration and secrets**: Pulumi's projects and stacks model makes it easy to share code between many disparate environments. Each stack can be configured so that infrastructure can be deliberately different between these environments. Pulumi integrates secrets management directly so it's easy to configure infrastructure using sensitive information like keys and tokens.

* **Use engineering best practices**: Thanks to the use of general purpose languages, standard engineering practices just work. For instance, you can lint and test your infrastructure as code, manage dependencies using true software versioning, you can easily refactor your codebase, and more.

* **Ship continuously**: Pulumi integrates with over a dozen CI/CD systems, including Atlassian Bitbucket, CircleCI, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab Pipelines, and more. This enables you to preview deployments in the context of pull requests and perform them in response to merges and commits.

* **Enforce team policies**: Pulumi includes a policy as code engine that lets you enforce security, compliance, and reliability best practices across your team. You can choose from off the shelf policy packs or write your own using a general purpose language or Open Policy Agent (OPA). Policies are enforced at deployment time to issues never make their way into production.

* **Collaborate securely and reliably**: Pulumi works best with the [Pulumi Cloud](https://www.pulumi.com/product/pulumi-cloud/), an optional SaaS companion that store infrastructure state and metadata securely and reliably.

* **Open source**: Pulumi is [proudly open source](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/pulumi-hearts-opensource/) and uses the Apache 2.0 license.
